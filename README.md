# UCSDGraphs

## Overview
- The aim of the project is to build a mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map. 
- The code being developed is what’s called “back-end” code, in that I worked with road data, but not directly with the front-end interface. The ideas is implement **Graph Algorithms** that fit firmly into this back-end functionality. However, a front end map interface that uses the Google Maps API is provided. 
- The project really looks and feels like Google Maps, However it is quite primitive compared to the real Google Maps!

### Project learning outcomes
- Design classes to implement a graph in Java
- Implement basic graph search algorithms including **breadth first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and **A* Search**.
- Work with real-world geographic road data
